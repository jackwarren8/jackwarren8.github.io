					hello my name is jack warren, and i am literally the best person ever, hence the name of the site. i am an 8th grade student. <br><br>

					i know someone named justin tran and he sucks. literally, his wallpaper on his laptop was a picture of me with<br>
					mean things written about me. luckily, I changed it. he is so rude. a picture of justin is below.<br><br>

					any time i make a quizlet or some other resource, i will post it on this website. it is also my portfolio.<br>
					thanks for reading this.
