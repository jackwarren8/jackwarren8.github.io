					Hello my name is Jack Warren, and I am literally the best person ever, hence the name of the site. I am an 8th grade student <br><br>

					I know someone named Justin Tran and he sucks. Literally, His wallpaper on his laptop is a picture of me with<br>
					mean things written about me. He is so rude.<br><br>

					Any time I make a quizlet or some other resource, I will post it on this website. It is also my portfolio.<br>
					Thanks for reading this. Also, my social security number is hidden in the inspect portion of this site so <br>
					if you find it you get a gold star.
